                <p>Now that it is February, it is strawberry season! This season is especially crucial in Florida, where most of the country's strawberries are grown. Most are grown in Plant City, Fla, a city in Polk County. There they also have an annual Strawberry Festival, which is similar to a state fair, to celebrate the season. Many public schools in the county also get a day off from school to celebrate the festival and the season.</p>
